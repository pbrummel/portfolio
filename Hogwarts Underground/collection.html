No wizarding household is complete without a copy of Fantastic Beasts, well thumbed by the generations who have riffled its pages in search of the best way to rid the lawn of Horklumps, interpret the mournful cries of the Augurey, or cure their pet Puffskein of drinking out of the toilet."

        <h4>by Edwardus Lima</h4>
        <!--Photo credit: Amazon.com, Warner Brothers-->
        <h5>Price: 4 Galleons</h5>
        <blockquote>"A vicious guide to monstrous creatures."—Description</blockquote>
        <p>The Monster Book of Monsters, by Edwardus Lima, is a particularly vicious sentient textbook that is used in Care of Magical Creatures while Rubeus Hagrid (who thought the book's aggressive nature was amusing) was the Professor for that subject at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
The book is quite informative, but one usually finds it difficult to access the information within due to the book's unfortunate tendency to try and bite off the reader's fingers. The only way to subdue the book is to stroke its spine, upon which the book opens placidly.</p>
